            location_description (Union[Unset, str]): Specifies the address or other textual description of the incidentâ€™s
                location.
            street (Union[Unset, str]): Specifies the name of the street on which the incident is occurring.
            polyline (Union[Unset, str]): Specifies the WGS84 latitude/longitude coordinates that describe the location of
                the incident.
                The decimal value should have at least 6 digits (to ensure accuracy of 0.11m or better).
                For any incident, you must submit at least two coordinates.
            direction (Union[Unset, IncidentsIncidentLocationDirection]): Specifies whether the disruption or closure
